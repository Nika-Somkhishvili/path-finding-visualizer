### Path Finding Visualizer
Available here: [bfs-dfs.netlify.app](https://bfs-dfs.netlify.app/ "bfs-dfs.netlify.app") 👈

This is a simple 2D website that can visualize different path-finding algorithms. It uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/ "p5.js") library for visuals and animations. You can use the built-in json input field to change:
- Number of nodes
- Edges between nodes
- Start and end nodes
- Max depth (for Depth-first search)
- Animation speed

### Algorithms available
- Depth-First Search (DFS) ❎ Does not guarantee the optimal path. Unweighted.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) ✅ - Guarantees the optimal path. Unweighted.
